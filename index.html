        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
            Our purpose is to make the youth 'THINK OF IT and nurture their leadership qualities because we can foresee a nation run by them. It is our aim to involve the youth in activities that require responsibility and brings out their individuality.
            By incorporating values of teamwork, empathy, leadership, decision-making and social responsibility our aim is to propagate social work and make the youth realize that "It's not enough to be compassionate. You must act" in the words of Dalai Lama.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
             Every opportunity presents its own set of problems. However those problems should never be the reason for us to give up on recognizing the potentialities.

 "THINK OF IT' sees that potential and the only solution is today's youth. It's an imperative task to recognize it and bring these gems to the forefront.
 The happiest people I know are those who lose themselves in the service of others-in the words of Gordon B. Hinckley, we see that giving back to the society is one duty that needs nothing in return yet it can be a fountain of peace to those who truly immerse themselves in it.

 'THINK OF IT' provides three programs in order to spark a change throughout the nation which will cater to character-building and awareness for the masses.

The solution is to lay out a path in front of the youth to walk collectively toward a better future.

            The "TOI-YOUTH LEADERSHIP PROGRAM' is, as is quite evident a program that aims to bring out the leadership qualities of the youth.
            Currently there are four projects that require the youth's attention and solutions Education, Food and Shelter, Sustainable Development & Environmental issues and Illegal & gender bias issues. They've the liberty to chose a project wherein lies their intrigue.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
            'When one teaches, two learn.' -in the words of Robert

Heinlein, 'REACH TO TEACH' program is one of its kind because by being deployed in government schools the youth acquire the values of kindness and hard work by teaching it to students.
'REACH TO TEACH' program aims to provide the students with soft skills along with practical skills. It encourages artistic gifts such as dance, music, etc. and would provide them with mentors who can help them

hone their skills even more.

Furthermore through our tie-ups with institutions of dance, music and other forms of art we intend to give them

a further push.
Hence, when we have given our 70 per cent and the rest is fulfilled by an institution, a child will be 100 per cent ready for the competitive world.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
            The youth, doubtlessly are the leaders of tomorrow. What are the common disadvantages that they have to deal with? Impulsiveness, cooperation, temperament, adaptation, to name a very few; we provide three core programs that will help them work on these common issues that hinder people from transforming into leaders of repute.
            "THINK OF IT' is for the youth, by the youth. The three foundational programs are a way of creating ripple effect in an ocean that is filled with devastations.
            "THINK OF IT' is creating a legacy that will live on in the form of those who are a part of us today.

By being a part of that legacy, by the investment of your time and efforts toward

something that will only bring harmony to the society and reduce the upheaval's that

prevail, you may deduce that your investment is for a good cause.

 It will foster their leadership instincts when they'll lead city chapters and learn to communicate

with others.

 There will be Youth Summits across the nation for the purpose of bringing together like-minded

individuals. A hierarchy will be maintained for the systematic functioning and those who emerge as highly
